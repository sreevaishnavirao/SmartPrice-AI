SmartPrice AI

SmartPrice AI is an Autonomous Agentic AI Framework designed to identify online deals, estimate fair prices, and notify users of special bargains in real time. The system leverages multi-agent collaboration, LLMs, and machine learning models to build a production-ready business use case for intelligent deal discovery.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Autonomous Multi-Agent Workflow â€“ Scanner, Planner, Ensemble, Specialist, and Messaging agents collaborate to process data and estimate prices.

RAG-based Price Estimation â€“ Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with ChromaDB vector store and LLMs.

Fine-Tuned Models â€“ Custom embeddings and price prediction with Random Forest Regressor and Ensemble Learning.

Push Notifications â€“ Automated messaging agent alerts users when new deals or significant bargains are found.

400K+ Products Processed â€“ Large-scale dataset used to build embeddings and benchmark the system.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack & Tools

LLM & NLP Frameworks:

OpenAI GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini for reasoning and RAG queries

Hugging Face Transformers & SentenceTransformers for embeddings
